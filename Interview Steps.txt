Courses:
    Intro to Algorithms Course on Udacity: 
        The course you just completed is essentially a prerequisite 
        of the Intro to Algorithms course. Intro to Algorithms is 
        largely about graph algorithmsâ€”you likely won't need most of 
        them for interviews, but if you're interested in graph 
        algorithms this is a great next step!
